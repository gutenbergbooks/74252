</div>


<p>The purpose of this book is to give
schoolgirls definite help in learning how
to keep themselves and other children
well and happy.</p>

<p>The problem is a double one: How
can we best safeguard the health of our
schoolgirls? and What can we do through
them to save the babies? To the first
question the answer is that we can teach
the girls the sacredness of life by instructing
them in personal hygiene and
in the care of the home. The object of
such instruction is to give each girl a
“sound mind in a sound body” and to
fit her for a woman’s work in the world.
The solution of the second part of the
problem is to be found in the careful
training of the schoolgirl in the general
principles of hygiene as applied to babies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span></p>

<p>Because the Health League classes
reach the girls during their formative
years, they offer a splendid opportunity
to establish those habits of life that make
for health and consequent happiness and
usefulness. Now as never before we are
coming to realize that the strength of a
nation depends primarily on the spiritual
and physical health of its citizens and
also on the training of its children to
assume in later years their duties as
fathers and mothers.</p>

<p>The author wishes to express her appreciation
and gratitude to the many persons
who have manifested interest in the
work of the Girls’ Health League, which
was launched under the auspices of the
Massachusetts State Federation of Women’s
Clubs. She wishes also especially
to thank the following: Mrs. Herbert J.
Gurney, President of the Massachusetts
State Federation of Women’s Clubs, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
her encouragement; Dr. Payson Smith,
Commissioner of Education of Massachusetts,
for his indorsement; John B.
Hawes, 2d, M. D., for his criticism and
advice; Margaret V. Grogan, M. D., for
her medical assistance; Miss Florence
Hilton, Director of Physical Education,
Framingham public schools, for illustrations
of posture; G. W. Cokell of Framingham
for photographic work of unusual
value; the Tri-Ad Studio artists for their
excellent designs.</p>

<p>Personal hygiene may be defined as
the wise and systematic care of the body.
The reasons why every girl should take
care of her body are:</p>

<p>First, good health means power to do
one’s work in life well.</p>

<p>Second, health is an aid to happiness
and personal attractiveness.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption center"><p>CORRECT POSTURE WHEN
STANDING</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Good health helps
to give a person an
active, cheerful mind,
and this makes one
alert, capable, and
able to work to the
best advantage. Good
health gives poise
and grace to the body
and helps to create
efficiency.</p>

<p>The following are
good rules:</p>

<ol class="pad4">
<li>Form health-giving
habits.</li>
<li>Let keeping well
and happy be one of
your most important
duties.</li>
</ol>

<p>The person who
honestly wishes to be useful must begin
at once to make good health a certainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center"><span class="smcap">Rules for Correct Posture</span></p>

<p><b>Standing.</b> We should stand correctly in
order that the organs of the body—heart,
lungs, stomach, liver, and kidneys—may
have room and be in position to do their
work well. We should stand erect, chin
in, chest high, abdomen flat, and with the
weight of the body resting on the balls
of the feet.</p>

<p><b>Walking.</b> In walking the weight of the
body should be thrown well forward.</p>

<p>It is correct to let the heel touch the
ground first, but the weight should very
quickly be transferred to the ball of the
foot. The correct position of the feet is
with the toes pointed straight forward.
This straight-foot position is characteristic
of our best athletes, our native Indians, and
others who are noted for great endurance
in running and walking. Two things are
essential: stockings should be a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
longer than the feet, and shoes should
be roomy at the toes and have heels not
more than one inch high.</p>

<p><b>Sitting.</b> As our schoolgirls sit many
hours each day, it is vital to their health
that they sit correctly. When sitting, one
should push back in the chair as far as
possible. In the resting position the
entire trunk should lean backwards
against the back of the chair; the hips
should not be allowed to slide forward
in the seat. In the active position the
trunk is held erect or inclined forward.
When leaning forward in a sitting position,
the trunk must be held erect or
inclined forward, and the bending should
be from the hips, not from the waistline.
Girls should not sit on one foot nor with
the knees crossed, as these positions interfere
with the circulation. When a person
is sitting, the feet may be crossed if a
change of position is desired.</p>

</figure>

<p><b>Carrying of schoolbooks.</b> In going to
and from school, books should be carried
on the right arm one day, on the left arm
the next day, or they may be divided and
carried partly on each arm. Of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the best plan is not to carry many books
home. All pupils should prepare as many
lessons during the study periods of each
school day as classes will permit.</p>

<p><b>Position when reading.</b> Children should
be taught at an early age not to let the
light, either natural or artificial, shine in
their eyes. The strongest light should
come from the left. Light from above is
the best. One should not read too long
at any one time without looking up at
some distant object in order to rest the
muscles of the eyes.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Care of the Skin</span></p>

<p>The skin is the outer covering of the
body. It serves as a protection to the
body and as an organ of excretion. Many
waste products which would act as poisons
if retained in the body are carried away
through the pores of the skin by means of
perspiration. This perspiration is produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
by sweat-producing glands. Closely related
to these are the oil-producing glands. The
constant presence of perspiration and oily
material from the glands makes it important
that the skin be kept clean so that
the pores may not become clogged.</p>

<p><b>Handkerchiefs.</b> It is important that the
child be supplied with clean handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and be taught the proper use of them.
A child should be told never to use a
handkerchief belonging to anyone else.
A handkerchief should be held before the
nose or mouth when coughing or sneezing.
One should never spit on the sidewalk,
in the house, or in any public place.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Baths</span></p>

<p><b>Cleansing bath.</b> The most important
bath is the cleansing bath of warm water
and soap, which should be taken at night
or after exercise. After taking this bath
one should dash or rub cold water over
the skin. The body should be quickly
dried and given a brisk rubbing with a
coarse towel to increase the circulation.</p>

<p><b>Cold bath.</b> A cool sponge bath, taken
the first thing in the morning, has a stimulating
effect on the body. It sends the
blood to the skin and quickens the circulation.
This bath should be followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
by a brisk rubdown with a rough towel.
A cold plunge bath should not be taken
without the advice of a physician, as cold
baths are not beneficial to everyone.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE CORRECT KIND OF TOOTHBRUSH</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Brushing the teeth.</b> The greatest factor
in preventing decay of the teeth is cleanliness.
The teeth should be brushed the
first thing in the morning and the last
thing at night, and, when convenient,
should be rinsed after eating. The lower
teeth should be brushed with a half-rotary
motion up, and the upper teeth should be
brushed down. This will assist in removing
particles of food from the teeth and
will prevent injury to the gums. Dental
floss should be used between the teeth.
Coarse food which requires much chewing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
strengthens the teeth and is excellent for
the digestion.</p>

<p>It is well to use a simple mouth wash
of one-half teaspoonful of soda or salt in
a glass of tepid water. Have the dentist
clean the teeth twice a year; do not wait
until the teeth ache before going to the
dentist.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Food</span></p>

<p>Food is that which supplies nourishment
to our bodies. Although many elements
enter into the composition of what
we eat, food is roughly divided into three
classes: proteids, carbohydrates, and fats.
Some foods contain all of these elements;
others contain only one or two of them.</p>

<p><b>Proteids.</b> The proteids build and repair
the tissues of the body and include such
substances as the lean of meat and fish,
the white of egg, milk, and parts of vegetables.
Dried peas, dried beans, and nuts
contain large percentages of proteid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p><b>Carbohydrates (sugars and starches).</b> Carbohydrates
form the essential parts of
vegetables and furnish body heat and
muscular power. Foods containing a large
percentage of starch are bread, potatoes,
rice, macaroni, tapioca, and cereals. Such
foods as candy, maple sirup, honey, and
molasses are almost entirely sugar; while
carrots, parsnips, and beets contain a large
percentage of sugar.</p>

<p><b>Fats.</b> Fats are the energy-producing
part of our diet. They may be of either
vegetable or animal origin—as cream,
butter, yolks of eggs, nuts, meat, and
fish fats.</p>

<p><b>Mixed diet.</b> A mixed diet consisting of
all the food elements in proper proportion
is necessary to supply material for the
normal growth of the body. Everyone
should eat vegetables freely not only because
they are good for the bowels (acting
as a wholesome laxative) but also because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
many of them, especially the green vegetables,
contain important organic matter,
such as iron.</p>

<p><b>Bread and butter.</b> Bread has often been
called the staff of life. In other words,
bread and butter alone form an almost
perfectly balanced meal. Bread should
never be eaten until it is at least twenty-four
hours old. Stale bread cut thin and
toasted in the oven until it is crisp is
appetizing and wholesome. Instead of giving
large amounts of bread and butter to
children three times a day, mothers should
substitute in part vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p><b>Coarse foods.</b> Coarse foods are especially
valuable because they require thorough
mastication, which is the real function
of the teeth. This helps to keep the
tongue and teeth clean. Another reason
for giving coarse foods to children is that
the circulation of blood in the gums and
throat is improved by chewing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p><b>Milk.</b> Milk contains all the essential
elements of a well-balanced diet and is
one of the most important foods. It
should be taken slowly and with other
food, such as graham crackers, and should
constitute an important part of the diet
of every child. Children up to fourteen
years of age should take milk, or milk
flavored with cocoa, in the place of tea
and coffee.</p>

<p><b>Water.</b> While water is not classed as a
food, it makes up three fifths of the total
of the fluids of the body and aids in the
elimination of the waste products of the
body. All foods contain some water, while
fruits and vegetables are largely composed
of it. A glass of water should be taken
before breakfast, in the middle of the
morning, and in the afternoon, and two
glasses in the evening. One glass may be
taken with the meals if it is taken after
the food in the mouth has been swallowed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Six or eight glasses of water should be
taken during every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><b>Candy.</b> Many people believe that candy
is harmful. This is because children, and
indeed adults, are apt to eat it at the
wrong time and to eat too much of it at
one time; nevertheless it has high food
value, and a little pure candy eaten once
a day, after a meal, is healthful.</p>

<p><b>Bowels.</b> When there is any trouble with
the stomach or bowels look for the cause
in some mistake or indiscretion in the
diet. The family physician should be
consulted.</p>

<p><b>Care of the bowels.</b> The bowels should
move at least once every day. A regular
habit of bowel movement can and should
be formed. The best time is in the morning,
after breakfast. Many of the head-aches,
muddy, pimply complexions, and
bad tempers are due to constipation. This
condition may be relieved by exercise, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the eating of coarse food, vegetables, fruits,
such as apples, prunes, and oranges, and
by drinking plenty of water.</p>

<p><b>Exercise.</b> Exercise, as either work or
play, is necessary because it stimulates
the action of all the organs of the body.
The blood circulates more freely during
exercise, and more waste products are
thrown off. One should not take violent
exercise immediately after eating; neither
should one exercise when unduly fatigued.
Work must be wisely alternated with play
and rest, because efficiency ends when a
person becomes overtired.</p>

<span class="bold fs80">HOME SANITATION</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Suggestions for demonstrations.</b> <b>1.</b> Demonstrate
the ventilation of a room. <b>2.</b> Demonstrate
the dusting of a room.</p>
</div>


<p>By home sanitation we mean keeping
the house clean and giving the forces
of nature, such as sunshine, fresh air, and
pure water, their fullest opportunity to
work for us. By letting the out of doors
indoors we give nature a fairer chance
at her great task of keeping us well and
happy.</p>

<p>The house is a protection for the family
and should have healthful and cheerful
surroundings. The housewife should understand
the principles of home sanitation
and thereby secure for her family a
healthy and happy life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<p><b>Location of the house.</b> The location of
the house is often decided more by necessity
or convenience than by the consideration
of health. If possible, a tenement or
house should be so situated as to secure
good air, sunshine, good drainage, and
good neighbors. A house with a southerly
exposure or placed with its corners to the
points of the compass has a distinct hygienic
value and is always to be preferred,
because it gets the sun in each room at
some time during the day.</p>

<p><b>Sunshine.</b> Abundant sunshine and light
in the home are of great importance, and
help to make the home healthful and more
cheerful. People living in rooms which
have no sun become pale and gradually
lose strength.</p>

<p><b>Pure air.</b> Sunshine and pure air are the
most important essentials for healthy life
in the home. Nothing will take the place
of fresh air. Everyone should be taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
to fill the lungs with it by slow, deep
breathing. We breathe on an average
eighteen times a minute, or 25,920 times
every twenty-four hours. No matter how
well rooms are ventilated, it is a good plan
to open the windows wide a few times each
day. This helps to rid the atmosphere of
impurities.</p>

<p><b>Oxygen.</b> Oxygen is the element in the
air that sustains life; it is inhaled through
the lungs, taken up by the blood, and carried
to all parts of the body.</p>

<p><b>Carbon dioxide.</b> The air also contains
carbon dioxide, which is a product of combustion
in many forms, such as respiration
and the decomposition of animal and vegetable
matter. Although enormous quantities
of carbon dioxide are constantly being
forced into the air, it is likewise being
removed constantly—especially by growing
vegetation. Plants and trees, under
the influence of sunlight, absorb much of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the carbon dioxide; therefore plants, which
many people like to have in their rooms,
not only please the eye but have a practical
value.</p>

<p>The condition of plants in the house is
a good test of home sanitation. If the
leaves drop off, probably the rooms are
overheated and the air too dry. There is
some truth in the saying, “Where plants
will not grow, people ought not to live.”
The breathing of impure air causes a
feeling of discomfort; the habitual breathing
of bad air causes headache and lessens
the resistance of the body to disease.</p>

<p><b>Impurities of air in homes.</b> Many conditions
may help cause bad air in our homes;
among these are mentioned overcrowding,
oil stoves, gas stoves, and the kind of
housekeeping which permits the accumulation
of dust and waste.</p>

<p><b>Good ventilation.</b> By good ventilation
we mean a sufficient supply of fresh air of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
suitable temperature and moisture, kept
systematically in motion. Moving air
serves a double purpose—that of bringing
to us a fresh supply and of taking away
the warm, moist, impure air by which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
are surrounded. The best and simplest
way to ventilate a room is to have one or
two windows open at both the top and the
bottom. During storms or in the winter
time, ventilation may be secured by covering
a wire screen with thin outing flannel.
This allows the entrance of fresh air
without drafts.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe50" id="image020">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image020.jpg" alt="A plant by an ajar
window with open curtains">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>IDEAL VENTILATION</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Drafts.</b> There is a superstition that
colds are caused by drafts. As a matter
of fact, moving air is a necessity, and
drafts do not cause colds. Drafts, sudden
chilling of the body, and dampness may
be predisposing causes, but in themselves
they will not produce a cold. Such conditions
lower the general vitality of the
body and favor the development of infection
when the specific cause is introduced.</p>

<p><b>Temperature of air.</b> The temperature of
the air has a very important bearing on
health. The harmful effect of extremes
of temperature has caused the death of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
many babies. The temperature of heated
rooms, during the day, should be between
68° and 70°F.</p>

<p><b>Humidity.</b> By humidity we mean the
moisture in the air. Many of the colds
which occur in the winter are due to the
dry air in homes and places of work.
Extreme dryness irritates the mucous
membranes of the nose and throat, and
this irritation is favorable to the development
of infection. Moisture may be
added to the air in two simple ways: by
keeping a dish of water on the radiator
and by keeping plants in the rooms, for
plants constantly throw off moisture.</p>

<p><b>Water.</b> The purity of the water that is
used in the household, whether it comes
from a public water supply or from a well
in the country, is a question of great importance.
Every housewife should know
the source from which the water used in
her household comes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p>Water is considered pure from the standpoint
of health when it is free from pollution,
color, odor, poisonous salts, and
turbidity. Clear, sparkling water is not
necessarily pure however. The purity of
water can be determined only by analysis.</p>

<p>In most states the public water supply
of cities and towns is inspected regularly
and the water is examined, so that the
people may be protected from danger of
infection. When the water used in a
household is obtained from a well or private
water supply, an analysis of it should
be made.</p>

<p>All wells should be carefully constructed
and covered, so that there may
be no danger of pollution from surface
drainage. Privy vaults should not be near
the well or so located that there will be
drainage from them to a well; otherwise
the germs of typhoid and other diseases
may find their way to it through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
ground and become a source of danger
to the persons using the water. As an
extra precaution all discharges from
persons who have tuberculosis, cholera,
dysentery, or typhoid fever should be
effectively disinfected before they are
emptied into a privy vault or into a
flush closet.</p>

<p><b>Purification of water.</b> If the purity of
the water is doubted, it should be boiled
for five or ten minutes in a clean, covered
kettle. This renders it safe. The flat
taste which often results from the boiling
may be remedied by shaking the water
in a bottle or pouring it from one clean
pitcher to another or by simply exposing
it to the air overnight. Water should
be kept cool, and should be protected
from dust.</p>

<p><b>Household filters.</b> The domestic filter
is of little value. It will remove visible
particles of matter, but will have very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
little effect upon bacteria. If such filters
are used, they should be carefully and intelligently
cleaned several times a day.</p>

<p><b>Care and arrangement of rooms.</b> All the
rooms in the house should be well ventilated
and kept scrupulously clean. The
windows should be entirely screened in
order that they may be opened at both
top and bottom. The screens should be
put on in the spring before the flies and
mosquitoes appear and should not be removed
until all danger from them is past.
Screens should be brushed frequently.</p>

<p><b>Dust and dusting.</b> Dust is brought into
the home on shoes and clothing, and is
blown in from the outside. Dust must
be kept under control by the use of a
vacuum cleaner, a carpet sweeper, or a
damp broom, and by good ventilation.
Children should not be allowed to remain
in rooms that are being swept, for dust
causes an irritation of the eyes, nose, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
throat and also is frequently a carrier of
disease germs. The dusting of furniture
should be done with a damp cloth. This
will wipe off the dust and not stir it up
into the air where it will be inhaled or
will settle again. A feather duster should
not be used. Dampened dusters may be
prepared in the following way: spread
the dusters out smoothly on a towel that
has been wrung out of hot water, roll, and
let them lie for half an hour before using.</p>

<p><b>The cellar.</b> The cellar should extend
under the entire house. If there is no
cellar, the space under the floor should
be well ventilated. There should be windows
on at least two sides of the cellar to
give ventilation and light, and the windows
should be well screened. The cellar
requires constant care and should be kept
not only dry but clean and free from rubbish
and substances that decay or absorb
and hold moisture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p><b>Care of food.</b> Young people should
learn to care for food in the home. Food
should be fresh, clean, and wholesome.
It should be protected from dust and
handled only with clean hands. The development
of bacteria may be prevented
by keeping the food cold and clean.
Fruits should be washed before being
used. The outer covering of berries is
easily bruised, and such fruits are frequently
contaminated by dust and flies.
Fruit should be full-grown but not over-ripe
when eaten. Vegetables such as
lettuce, celery, and radishes, that are
eaten uncooked, should be thoroughly
washed and rinsed in several waters.</p>

<p><b>Care of garbage.</b> Garbage consists chiefly
of the refuse matter from the kitchen. It
should be kept in a clean metal can with
a tight-fitting cover, since it will attract
flies, rats, and other vermin. It is important
that the can be frequently emptied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and cleaned. Be careful that broken glass,
broken dishes, nails, tacks, or old papers are
not mixed with the kitchen refuse. Have
a separate can or barrel for ashes and all
glass and metal rubbish. The fair criterion
of good housekeeping is the amount of
garbage. A large amount of garbage means
carelessness and waste in the kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Dishcloth and dish towels.</b> Beware of
a greasy, damp, disease-carrying dishcloth
that is hung in a warm, dark place. The
dishcloth and dish towels should be kept
clean by washing them with soap and hot
water every day. They should be hung
out in the sunshine in the open air.</p>

<p><b>Clean hands.</b> Clean hands mean more
than personal cleanliness. They mean
clean door knobs, furniture, and clothing.
The hands should be washed frequently
with warm water and soap, and always
before handling food, after going to the
toilet, and before taking the baby.</p>

</div>


<p><b>First care of baby.</b> The hands should
be carefully washed before handling the
baby. When the baby comes his eyes
must be washed with a two per cent solution
of boric acid.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The proper care of the
eyes at this time may be the means of
preserving the eyesight. A fresh piece
of cotton should be used for each eye.
Always wash the lids from the nose toward
the outer corner of the eye; then
burn the cotton. The baby should then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
be placed upon his right side, with his
head a little lower than his body.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> See <a href="#APPENDIX_B">Appendix B</a>, p. 109.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Oil bath.</b> When the baby is born there
is on his skin, particularly in the creases,
a white cheeselike substance that can be
removed only with oil. Therefore the
baby’s first bath should be of warm olive
oil or vaseline, applied with a piece of soft
cotton and allowed to remain for an hour
or more and then very gently wiped off.
A water bath should not be given until
the second day.</p>

<p><b>A sponge bath.</b> A sponge bath should
be given daily up to the sixth or ninth
day, after which the warm tub bath should
be substituted. Essentials for the bath are:</p>

<ol class="pad4">
<li>A warm room (72° F.)</li>
<li>A bath thermometer</li>
<li>A large flannel bath apron</li>
<li>Two basins of warm water</li>
<li>Two soft washcloths</li>
<li>Two large soft towels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></li>
<li>Olive-oil soap or pure castile soap</li>
<li>Pure talcum powder</li>
<li>Two per cent boric-acid solution</li>
<li>Absorbent cotton</li>
</ol>

<p>The toilet articles should be kept on a
white enamel tray, which is easy to clean.
After everything is prepared for the bath
the fresh clothing should be warmed. The
mother puts on her apron and takes the
baby in her lap; she then undresses him
and wraps him in the bath apron. The
temperature of the bath should be 100° F.
by the thermometer, and this should never
be guessed at, because the water feels very
much warmer to the sensitive skin of
the baby than to the hand of an adult.
The head and face are first washed
with the warm water and carefully dried.
The body is then bathed with the warm
water and soap, rinsed with clear water,
wrapped in soft towels, and dried by patting.
Great care must be taken to dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
thoroughly all the folds and creases of the
skin. A little lanolin or sweet oil should
then be gently rubbed into the folds or a
little talcum powder may be dusted on the
neck, behind the ears, under the arms and
knees, in the groin, and on the buttocks.
Wipe away all superfluous powder, as it is
apt to get wet and cake, and will then
irritate the skin.</p>

<p>For the tub bath see page <a href="#PREPARATION_FOR_THE_BATH">63</a>.</p>

<p><b>Dressing the baby.</b> In dressing and
undressing the baby the garment should
be put on and off over the feet. This will
prevent dust or other foreign particles on
the clothing from entering the eyes, nose,
or mouth of the baby. After the baby is
dressed his nose, ears, and eyes should
be cleaned by means of twisted cotton
dipped in a two per cent solution of boric
acid. A fresh piece of cotton should be
used for each eye, ear, and nostril and
should then be burned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Development</span></p>

<p><b>Crying.</b> It is necessary for a newborn
baby to cry a little every day; this tends
to expand his lungs.</p>

<p><b>Sight.</b> A newborn baby is not able to
distinguish objects, but his eyes are very
sensitive to light and must be carefully
protected.</p>

<p><b>Hearing.</b> The hearing soon becomes
acute; therefore loud and sudden noises
should be avoided, as they startle and excite
the baby. It is well to keep him in
a room away from noise and confusion.</p>

<p><b>Speech.</b> When six or seven months old
a baby begins to try to utter words and
will usually be able to say a few words
when nine or ten months old. The average
child, however, does not begin to form
sentences of more than two or three words
until he is about eighteen months or two
years of age.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE BABY’S BED</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Baby’s bed.</b> The newborn baby sleeps
about nine tenths of the time. He should
have a bed by himself. The first bed may
be made in an ordinary clothes basket or
in a light box. Table padding makes a
good mattress if folded to six thicknesses,
because it is easily laundered and is inexpensive.
When washed it should be dried
out of doors in the sunshine. If the material
used in the crib mattress is excelsior,
it should be made as smooth as possible,
with a soft pad placed on top of it. Curled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
hair is more expensive, but is light, cool,
and easily cleansed. The crib mattress
should always be protected by a piece of
rubber sheeting covered with a soft pad.
The baby’s bed should be raised at least
twelve inches from the floor to escape drafts.</p>

<p><b>Pillows.</b> The baby’s head should not be
elevated, as he will take more air into his
lungs when no pillow is used. If the
mother wishes, she may place a folded soft
cloth under the baby’s head.</p>

<p><b>Birth registration.</b> See that the baby’s
birth is promptly and accurately registered.

<p><b>Protection against flies and mosquitoes.</b>
The baby must be protected from flies
and mosquitoes because malaria and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
diseases may be transmitted in this way.
Flies are carriers of filth and disease
germs and therefore should never be
allowed to touch the baby’s lips or the
baby’s bottle.</p>

<p>It is important that netting be placed
over the baby’s bed and be large enough
to tuck in under the mattress. It should
not hang down over the sides of the bed.</p>

<p>Every mother should nurse her baby
if she is well and has the milk; it is
her most important duty for the time
being, and all other things should be
secondary to it.</p>

<p><b>The reasons.</b> Breast milk is nature’s
food for the baby. It is fresh, sterile,
and always at hand. It is the least expensive
food that can be given, and contains
the proper elements of food in the
right proportions.</p>

<p>Breast-fed babies seldom have bowel
troubles—which are apt to be so fatal
in bottle-fed babies, especially in hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
weather. Ten bottle-fed babies die to one
fed on the breast.</p>

<p><b>Hours for nursing.</b> At the end of the
first twenty-four hours the baby is put
to the breast. Because of the scant
quantity of milk in the breasts, every
four or six hours is often enough for the
first two days. Until the mother’s milk
comes no food should be given to the
baby except a little cool boiled water,
not sweetened. If the milk is very
scanty, the physician will probably order
a few bottle feedings. For a normal baby
the following feedings are recommended:</p>

<p>The mother should nurse her baby
regularly and give nothing between feedings
except unsweetened boiled water.
If the baby is awakened at feeding
times during the day, he will soon form
the habit of nursing regularly.</p>

<p><b>How to hold the baby.</b> While the baby
is nursing do not hold him too closely
to the breast, as he must have plenty of
air to breathe. If the baby is nursing
from the right breast, he should be held
on the right arm, and the mother’s left
hand should press the breast away from
the baby’s nose.</p>

<p><b>Length of nursing time.</b> The baby
should not nurse more than ten minutes
at first nor more than twenty minutes at
any time. He should not be allowed to
fall asleep while nursing nor be permitted
to take his meal too rapidly, as this latter
may cause him to hiccup. If a baby
nurses too rapidly, withdraw the nipple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
from his mouth for a few seconds. This
may be done every three or four minutes.</p>

<p><b>Baby’s stomach.</b> The infant generally
takes more fluid at each feeding than the
stomach can hold at one time. Almost
as soon as the milk is swallowed it begins
to pass into the intestines. Breast
milk is digested and passed on more
rapidly than cow’s milk.</p>

<p><b>Mixed feedings.</b> When the mother’s
milk is of good quality, but is not sufficient
in quantity to satisfy the baby, it is
necessary to give him additional food.
This is done by giving alternate feedings
of the breast milk and modified
milk. Mixed feedings should always be
given under the doctor’s directions. Every
bit of breast milk helps the baby, because
it tends to make the digestion of artificial
food easier.</p>

<p><b>Advice to nursing mothers.</b> Keep yourself
well. As long as you are well the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
baby will keep well. Even though you
have but little milk at first, do not get
discouraged; be patient and persevering.
You should have lunches of milk and
gruel—one in the middle of the morning,
one in the afternoon, and another at
bedtime. Remember that an active, cheerful
mind is an important factor in good
health. Nothing upsets a baby more
quickly than a nervous, irritable mother.</p>

<p><b>Diet of a nursing woman.</b> The meals
should be simple and nutritious and should
include a large amount of liquid. Milk,
cereals, eggs, and soups should form the
principal part of the diet. Some of the
foods to be avoided by a nursing woman
are cabbage, onions, garlic, and sour fruits.</p>

<p><b>Weaning.</b> The healthy baby should be
weaned from the breast between the
ninth and the eleventh month. Every
baby ought to be weaned entirely at the
age of one year, but it is better not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
wean him during the summer. If a baby
has been taught to take water from a
spoon or cup, there will be no trouble
at the weaning period in having him take
his milk from a cup. Weaning should
take place gradually. During the process
the mother should take less liquids and
usually some laxative to produce free
movements of the bowels.</p>

<p><b>Weigh the baby.</b> The baby should be
weighed once a week. Scales similar to
grocers’ scales, with a basket attached,
may be used, as they are more accurate
than spring scales.</p>

<p><b>Directions for weighing.</b> Have the scales
in a warm place, protected from drafts.
Undress the baby, wrap him in a small
blanket, and place him in the basket
on the scales. Write down the total
weight; then lift the baby out, weigh the
basket and blanket together, and subtract
this amount from the first weight. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
average healthy baby weighs from seven
to seven and one-half pounds at birth,
and his average length is twenty inches.
A healthy baby usually doubles his weight
at the end of the fifth month, and by the
end of the first year weighs three times
as much as at birth. For instance, if
he weighs seven pounds at birth, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
should weigh fourteen pounds at the end
of the fifth month and twenty-one pounds
at the end of the first year.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>WEIGHING THE BABY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If the length is twenty inches at birth,
the baby should grow about four inches
during the first five months and eight
inches during the first year. The following
table shows the actual gain in weight
of a healthy baby that was breast fed:</p>

<p><b>Foods.</b> Condensed milk and proprietary
foods should be used only in emergency
or on the advice of a physician.
They are of value only in the rare instances
when a baby cannot digest cow’s
milk or when prescribed by a physician.</p>

<p><b>Cow’s milk.</b> If a baby cannot have
breast milk, the next best food is properly
modified cow’s milk. Cow’s milk, when
used for the baby, must be fresh. It
should be delivered in sealed bottles.
Milk sold from open cans should never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
be given to a child. Milk should not be
left standing on the doorstep nor in a
warm kitchen, but should be placed in the
ice box as soon as received, where it
should be kept covered and at a temperature
between 35° and 45° F.</p>

<p><b>Choice of milk.</b> Whenever possible, certified
milk should be used. <em>Certified milk</em>
is milk produced under conditions that
conform to certain standards of cleanliness
laid down by the state. Uncertified
milk may of course often be used without
danger, but if there is any question about
its purity, it should be pasteurized (see

<p>No matter how cow’s milk is modified,
it differs from human milk in certain
other ways that we do not understand,
and this renders it less desirable for infant
feeding than human milk.</p>

<p><b>Modified milk.</b> The formula for the
baby’s food must be given by a nurse or
a physician. The following general directions
for feeding a baby that does not require
a special formula have been prepared
by a committee of the American Medical
Association:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beginning on the third day the average baby
should be given three ounces of milk daily, diluted
with seven ounces of water. To this
should be added one tablespoon of limewater
and two level teaspoons of sugar. This should
be given in seven feedings.</p>

<p>At one week the average child requires five
ounces of milk daily, which should be diluted
with ten ounces of water. To this should be
added one and one-half even teaspoons of sugar
and one ounce of limewater. This should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
given in seven feedings. The milk should be
increased by one-half ounce about every four
days. The water should be increased by one-half
ounce every eight days.</p>
</div>

<figure class="figcenter illowe50" id="image049">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image049.jpg" alt="Two women preparing milk">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>MODIFICATION OF THE MILK</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At three months the average child requires
sixteen ounces of milk daily, which should be
diluted with sixteen ounces of water. To this
should be added three tablespoons of sugar and
two ounces of limewater. This should be given
in six feedings. The milk should be increased
by one-half ounce every six days. The water
should be reduced by one-half ounce about
every two weeks.</p>

<p>At six months the average child requires
twenty-four ounces of milk daily, which should
be diluted with twelve ounces of water. To this
should be added two ounces of limewater and
three even tablespoons of sugar. This should
be given in five feedings. The amount of milk
should be increased by one-half ounce every week.
The milk should be increased only if the child
is hungry and digesting his food well. It should
not be increased unless he is hungry, nor if he
is suffering from indigestion, even though he
seems hungry.</p>

<p>At nine months the average child requires
thirty ounces of milk daily, which should be
diluted with ten ounces of water. To this should
be added two even tablespoons of sugar and two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
ounces of limewater. This should be given in
five feedings. The sugar added may be milk
sugar or, if this cannot be obtained, cane (granulated)
sugar or maltose (malt sugar). At first
plain water should be used to dilute the milk.</p>

<p>At three months, sometimes earlier, a weak
barley water may be used in the place of plain
water; it is made of one-half level tablespoon of
barley flour to sixteen ounces of water and cooked
for twenty minutes. (See <a href="#APPENDIX_B">Appendix B</a>.)</p>

<p>Fill the feeding bottles, cork them, and put
on the ice. If the milk is not certified, it should
be pasteurized.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Utensils.</b> The utensils used for preparing
the baby’s food should be reserved
exclusively for that purpose. The best
material for these utensils is enamel or
agateware.</p>


<p class="center">LIST OF UTENSILS</p>

<ol class="pad4">
<li>A big covered kettle or dish pan. This
should measure at least eighteen inches in diameter,
so that all other utensils may be boiled in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
</li>
<li>Bottles. There should be as many bottles
as there are feedings in one day.</li>
<li>Nipples. It is important to select those

<li>A bottle brush.</li>
<li>A nipple brush.</li>
<li>A sixteen-ounce graduated measuring glass.</li>
<li>A tablespoon, teaspoon, and cream dipper.</li>
<li>A teapot of enamel or agateware in which
sterile water is kept for use as needed.</li>
<li>A wire rack for holding bottles.</li>
<li>A roll of nonabsorbent cotton for the
stoppers for the feeding bottles.</li>
</ol>

<p id="PASTEURIZING"><b>Pasteurizing.</b> This process consists of
heating the milk to 145° F. and keeping
it at this temperature for thirty minutes.
The following method may be used: Fill
the bottles with the modified milk and
place in the wire rack. Put the rack in
a dish of water, with the water just above
the level of the milk. Suspend a milk
thermometer in the water and heat until
the thermometer registers 145° F. Keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
at this temperature for thirty minutes,
then take out the rack and cork the
bottles at once. Place carefully in a dish
of cool water or put an inverted basin over
the rack containing the bottles and set
under the cold-water faucet. Cool quickly
and place on the ice at once.</p>

suspended in a pot of water">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>PASTEURIZING THE BABY’S MILK</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If no pasteurizing outfit is at hand, the
bottles of milk may be heated in a double
boiler until the steam arises. Continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
heating at this temperature for fifteen
minutes. If the pasteurized milk is used
for a long time, it is well to give the baby
orange juice to prevent rickets and scurvy.
This should be given in the morning, regularly,
three quarters of an hour before
feeding time. One teaspoonful should be
given at first, and the amount gradually
increased up to one tablespoonful.</p>

<p><b>Homemade refrigerator.</b> An ice box to
keep the baby’s milk in good condition
may be made in the following way at
very little cost: In a wooden box about
eighteen inches square and of about the
same depth, put a layer of sawdust three
inches deep. Then put a ten-quart pail
(or a larger one) in the center of the box.
Add more sawdust and put a cardboard
collar around the pail, to keep the sawdust
in place. It is also well to put a
layer of cheesecloth over the sawdust.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Inside this pail place another (smaller) one,
to hold the ice. The bottles are put in
the larger pail, which should be securely
covered, and a bag of sawdust is placed
over it. The box should be tightly closed
by a wooden cover lined with several
thicknesses of newspaper. The inner pail
should be taken out and cleaned every
morning.</p>

<p>The box described above will keep
cold for twenty-four hours with five cents’

be left off any longer than is necessary
to remove the bottles.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>FILLING THE BABY’S BOTTLES</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Care of bottles.</b> New bottles should be
placed in a kettle of cold water, put on
the stove, and boiled for twenty minutes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
They should then be removed from the
stove, but left in the kettle until the water
cools. Bottles treated in this way will not
break easily.</p>

<p>As soon as the baby has finished feeding,
the bottles should be rinsed with cold
water, cleaned with a bottle brush in clear
hot water, then filled with fresh water
and set aside. In the morning, before the
day’s food is prepared, all bottles should
be scrubbed with hot water and Ivory
soap; they should then be rinsed thoroughly
in several waters, boiled in a solution
consisting of two teaspoonfuls of soda
to one quart of water, and rinsed in clear
boiled water.</p>

<p><b>Care of bottle nipples.</b> New nipples
should always be scrubbed and boiled for
three minutes before being used. It is
better to buy nipples that can be turned
inside out. There should always be at
least two nipples clean and ready for use.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Immediately after the feeding the nipple
should be removed from the bottle, washed
in cold water, scrubbed inside and outside,
rinsed well, and placed in a jar of sterile
water or a two per cent solution of boric
acid. Nipples should be boiled daily for
about three minutes.</p>

<p>When it is time to feed the baby the
bottle should be taken from the ice box
and placed (still corked) in a dish of water
deep enough to come above the milk line.
The water is to be heated until the milk is
warmed. The water should not boil, as that
renders the milk less easy to digest and is
apt to make the baby constipated. A clean
cloth should be placed in the bottom of the
dish or kettle, to prevent the bottle from
slipping and breaking. The temperature
of the milk should be tested by dropping
some of it on the inner surface of the
arm. If it feels warm to the skin, it is
the correct temperature for the baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>The mother should never put the nipple
into her own mouth to test the temperature.
The nipple should be handled only
by the neck; the part that goes into the
baby’s mouth should never be touched.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>TESTING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MILK</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Holding the baby while feeding.</b> The
baby should be held by the mother or
nurse in the same position as for breast
feeding. The bottle should be held so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
that the neck is continually filled, in order
that the baby may not suck in air. The
feeding should be finished in twenty
minutes. If the baby nurses too rapidly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
withdraw the nipple for a moment several
times during the feeding. If the baby
falls asleep, the bottle should be removed,
and no more milk should be given until
the next feeding time; he should not
be permitted to nurse a little and then
sleep a little, and thus unduly prolong

<p><b id="PREPARATION_FOR_THE_BATH">Preparation for the bath.</b> A tub bath
may be given to the baby as early as the
sixth or ninth day. The morning bath
should be given three quarters of an
hour before the nine o’clock feeding. The
mother should wash her hands carefully
before handling the baby. The temperature
of the room in which the bath is
given should not be below 72° F. If the
room is too hot—so hot that the baby
perspires—there is grave danger of his
being chilled when the bath is over.</p>

</figure>

<p>The tub should never be put on the
floor, but always on a chair or low table.
This makes it easier for the mother to
give the bath and also helps protect the
baby from dust and drafts. Screens should
be used to secure complete protection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
from drafts. For the first four weeks the
temperature of the water should be between
98° and 100° F. As the baby grows
older the temperature should be gradually
lowered. Suitable temperatures are</p>

<p class="noindent pad4">
100° F. at birth<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">98° F. at one month</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">95° F. at three months</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">90° F. at six months</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">85° F. at twelve months</span><br>
</p>

<p>If the baby is bluish and does not react
well, it means that the water was not the
right temperature or that he was in the
water too long. Always use a bath thermometer;
never guess at the temperature.</p>

<p>After everything is prepared for the
bath and the clean clothing warmed, undress
the baby. He should be weighed
once a week, at this time.</p>

<p><b>The bath.</b> He should then be wrapped in
a warm blanket and held in the lap while his
eyes, ears, nose, face, and head are washed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p><em>The nose and the ears.</em> The inside of the
baby’s nose should be carefully cleaned
every day with a soft, wet twist of absorbent
cotton. The external ears should be
washed daily. No attempt should be made
to clean the inside of the ears except with
a piece of cotton wound around the end
of the little finger.</p>

<p><em>The eyes.</em> The eyes should be cleaned
each morning, at first with a two per cent
solution of boric acid, and after two months
with warm sterile water. A separate piece
of cotton should be used for each eye.
The lids should be washed from the nose
toward the outer corner of the eye. If the
eyes show a mattery secretion and the
lids are swollen, a physician should be
consulted at once. Infection of the eyes
has often resulted in blindness.</p>

<p><em>The mouth.</em> The baby’s mouth should
be cleaned once a day by the use of a
swab, made by twisting a bit of absorbent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
cotton on a wooden toothpick, wet in
a two per cent solution of boric acid.
After each feeding a teaspoonful of warm,
sterile water may be given to wash the
milk down. The old method of cleansing
the mouth with a piece of gauze twisted
over the finger frequently injured the
delicate tissues. Except in emergency the
finger should not be put inside the baby’s
mouth.</p>

<p><em>The scalp.</em> For the first few weeks
the baby’s scalp should be washed at the
time of the bath. If yellow scales form,
rub warm olive oil or vaseline into the
scalp at night, and in the morning wash
it with warm water and pure castile soap,
rinsing thoroughly. If the scales do not
come off, repeat the operation as many
times as necessary. Do not use a comb
to remove the scales, as this will irritate
the scalp and render the condition
worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<p><em>The nails.</em> The baby’s nails should be
cleaned with a toothpick over which has
been twisted a little absorbent cotton.
The nails should be carefully cut with
small scissors in order to prevent him
from scratching himself.</p>

<p><em>The body.</em> It is best to wash the baby’s
entire body with warm water and soap
before placing him in the tub. The bath
in the tub is for rinsing off the soap and
for exercise. He should be turned over so
that his chest will rest on the mother’s
forearm while his feet touch the bottom
of the tub. Teach the baby to like the
bath, and he will not be frightened. He
should not stay in the water more than
two or three minutes, and when lifted out
should be wrapped in a soft, warm bath
towel. He should be dried quickly by
gently patting the skin with soft towels,
not by wiping. Take special care to dry
all the folds and creases; rub these with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
sweet oil or lanolin, or powder them carefully.
Powder, if used, should be lightly
dusted on the neck, behind the ears, under
the arms and knees, in the groin, and on
the buttocks. Rub off all superfluous
powder; if it gets wet and hardens, it
will irritate the skin.</p>

<p><em>Dressing.</em> The baby should always be
dressed while lying on his back or on a
bed or pillow. Pin the flannel band at the
side with small safety pins; then put on
the shirt and be careful that the draw
string at the neck is not tied too tightly.
Next put on the diaper snugly. The gertrude
is placed inside the slip and both
are put on at the same time. These two
garments should be drawn on over the
baby’s feet. If the weather is cool, the
baby should be wrapped in a flannel
blanket.</p>

<p><em>Bran bath.</em> If the baby’s skin is sensitive
or if he has heat rash, a bran bath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
will prove beneficial. Prepare this by putting
bran into a cheesecloth bag six inches
square, and soaking this in the bath until
the water is milky. Do not use soap with
the bran bath, nor with an ordinary bath
when the baby’s skin is sensitive.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Flannel bands.</b> These bands should be

and about twenty-eight inches long, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
is, long enough to reach twice around the
baby’s body. They should have no hems
and should be fastened at the left side
with small safety pins. Bands must be
adjusted with great care; they should not
be drawn too tightly, but should be made
so snug that they will neither slip down
and bind the baby’s legs nor slip up and
interfere with the expansion of the chest.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe50" id="image072">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image072.jpg" alt="An assortman of baby clothes">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BABY CLOTHES</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p><b>Knitted bands.</b> Knitted bands may be
of wool and cotton or of silk and wool.
Next to the smallest size is the most
practical one to buy. It should fit snugly,
should not wrinkle, and should not have
rough seams.</p>

<p><b>Shirts.</b> Baby shirts come in several sizes
and weights. It is well to begin with the
second size, as the first size is so soon outgrown.
They should be high-necked, long-sleeved,
and should open all the way down
the front. Silk and wool is the best material
because it is light in weight and wears
well. The lightest weight should be worn
in summer, a little heavier weight in the
spring and fall, and a still heavier in the
winter. There is a tendency in winter
time to use shirts that are too heavy. The
result is that the baby perspires too freely.
This makes his clothing damp and renders
him more liable to take cold. Babies
living in overheated houses and wearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
clothing that is too warm soon become
sensitive to cold and drafts and are less
able to resist sickness.</p>

<p><b>Flannel gertrudes.</b> The gertrudes should
be made of all-wool flannel or of wool and
cotton. They should open on the shoulders.</p>

<p><b>Dresses.</b> The dresses should be simply
made of soft material. They should be
laundered without starch. Both the shirt
and the dress should be loose around
the baby’s neck and arms, since any tightness
or roughness in the clothing may
irritate the skin.</p>

<p><b>Nightgowns.</b> Nightgowns may be made
of flannel, stockinet, cotton, or flannelette.
The winter nightgowns should be long
enough to allow the bottom to be closed
by a draw string. This will make sure that
the baby’s feet are covered at all times
even if he kicks off his bedclothes.</p>

<p><b>Diapers.</b> Diapers should be made of
bird’s-eye linen, cotton, or stockinet. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
a young baby they should measure about
eighteen or twenty inches square and be
folded but once. Never use a folded inside
diaper, as a wad of thick material
between the legs is injurious. A small
inside folded cloth five inches square may
be used, or a quilted pad about ten inches
square may be laid under the baby after
the diaper is on. This pad will protect the
skirts from urine. During the mother’s
waking hours the diaper should be changed
as often as it is wet or soiled. In the night
it should be changed when the baby is taken
up for feeding or if he is restless.</p>

<p>All diapers should be washed each time
after they become wet. The soap used in
washing them should be carefully rinsed
out, and they should be boiled thoroughly
at least twice a week. A careless soaking
and wringing through one or two waters
is not an adequate cleansing. Care must
be taken in selecting the soap to be used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
in washing the diapers, since some soaps
will cause an irritation of the skin, even
when the clothing has been well rinsed.</p>

<p><b>Stockings.</b> It is important to keep the
baby’s legs and feet warm. Stockings and
diapers should meet. In cold weather the
baby should wear stockings; in summer he
will not require any covering for his feet.</p>

<p><b>Short clothes.</b> The baby should be put
into short clothes about the fifth month,
for at that time he begins to show signs
of wanting to use his legs and to kick. It
is not wise, however, to make this change
during very cold weather.</p>

<p><b>Clothing in summer.</b> The greatest care
should be taken to see that the baby is
not dressed too warmly in summer. Too
heavy clothing whether in summer or in
winter will make him perspire too freely
and render him more liable to colds and
bowel troubles. The mother should feel
of his body occasionally; if she finds it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
constantly moist, the clothing is too warm.
In summer only the thinnest undershirts
should be worn, and warmer outer garments
should be added as it grows cool
toward night. Light-weight knitted or
crocheted jackets are easily made.</p>

<p><b>Clothing in winter.</b> Clothing should
always be adapted to the season. If the
baby is not dressed warmly enough, he
will have cold hands and feet, and his legs
and arms will be bluish. A baby must
have fresh air, but his body must be kept
warm. This is most important; unless
this is done his vital force will be lessened
and he will not gain as he should. When
taken out he must be warmly dressed with
a long woolen or wool-lined coat with a
shoulder cape. In cold weather a silk cap
with a lining of wool is best. Take care
that the neck of the coat and the cap ribbons
are not too tight. Leggings will be
necessary after the baby is in short clothes.</p>

<span class="bold fs80">HABITS AND TRAINING</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Suggestions for demonstrations.</b> <b>1.</b> Demonstrate
how to protect a baby from flies and mosquitoes
when sleeping. <b>2.</b> Show how to support
a baby over a chamber.</p>
</div>

<p>Do not forget that during infancy life’s
habits are being formed and that this
period is of greater educational importance
than any other of his life.</p>

<p>The normal baby is well and happy.
Babies who are properly fed and kept
clean, who have plenty of sleep and fresh
air and are trained in regular habits, are
usually well and good-natured. On the
other hand, if babies are fussy and restless
most of the time, there is something
wrong. Patiently search for the cause of
the trouble and see that it is removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p><b>Sleep.</b> A newborn baby sleeps about
nine tenths of the time. He should not be
disturbed except for necessary care. After
he has been made comfortable and fed he
should be laid in his crib and trained to
go to sleep without rocking and without
a pacifier of any kind.</p>

<p>The daily amount of sleep required for
different ages is approximately as follows:</p>

<p class="noindent pad4">
First month                18 to 20 hours<br>
Second to sixth month      16 to 18 hours<br>
Sixth month                14 to 16 hours<br>
One to two years           12 to 14 hours<br>
</p>

<p>During the first year a nap in the middle
of the forenoon, and another in the
afternoon, is desirable. The afternoon nap
should not be so late as to interfere with
the night’s sleep.</p>

<p>A healthy baby sleeps with his mouth
closed. Mouth breathing is caused by
some obstruction in the air passages, usually
enlarged tonsils or adenoids. Other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
signs of the presence of adenoids may
be restlessness at night, snoring during
sleep, or frequent attacks of head colds.
When any one of these symptoms is
present the child should be placed under
a physician’s care at once; otherwise its
normal growth and health may be seriously
retarded.</p>

<p>The sleeping room should be dark, well
ventilated, and quiet. The baby should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
always be protected from drafts, but the air
should be fresh and cool. After being fed
he should be placed on his side, and after
the next feeding, laid on the opposite side.</p>

<p><b>Sleeping out.</b> After a baby is six weeks
old he should take his naps out of doors
when the weather permits. He should be
protected from flies and mosquitoes and
shielded from the sun, wind, and dust.
Remove the shoes and loosen the clothing
before placing him in his crib. If the
weather is cool, his feet and body must
be kept warm.</p>

<p><b>Bowel movement.</b> The baby’s first stools
are of tarlike consistency, with little or
no odor. After a day or two the stools
change to a light yellow in color, are soft
in consistency, and have little or no odor.
During the first week the bowels move
two or three times a day. As the child
grows older, one or two movements a
day will be sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>The mother should begin to train the
baby to use a chamber as early as the
third month. He should be placed on a
small chamber held between the mother’s
knees, his back being supported against
her body. In order to form the habit of
having the bowels move regularly this
should be done at the same hour each day.
If the bowels do not move, insert a soap
or glycerine suppository into the rectum.
This will help direct the baby’s attention
to the reason for his being placed on
the vessel, and the suppository starts the
bowels moving. This habit is soon established.
The child should be placed on the
chamber after the early morning feeding
and again in the afternoon.</p>

<p><b>Bladder.</b> Habits of regularity in emptying
the bladder may be formed by placing
the baby on the vessel every three or four
hours during the day and the last thing
at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p><b>Thumb sucking.</b> The habit of thumb or
finger sucking begins in early infancy
and may continue until the child is six
or eight years old if it is not broken. If
persisted in, it may cause marked deformities
of the jaws and teeth. When
the thumb or finger is put into the mouth
it should be gently but firmly removed.
By this method the habit will be gradually
overcome. It may be necessary to
pin the sleeves to the side of the dress,
so that the arms cannot be raised.</p>

<p><b>Pacifier.</b> Never use a rubber nipple,
sugar ball, or any other pacifier.</p>

<p><b>Kissing.</b> Under no circumstances should
anyone kiss a baby on the mouth. Common
colds, tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping
cough, measles, and many other diseases
are transmitted in this way. Remember
that disease may be present in the secretions
of the mouth and nose and on
the lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<p><b>Crying.</b> A well baby never cries without
cause. Normal crying is loud and
forceful, and the mother will soon learn
to distinguish it from the cry of pain,
hunger, or discomfort. A baby has no
other way of expressing his needs—therefore
his cry should be heeded. When he
cries the mother should see that he is
made comfortable, that his hands and feet
are warm, that his diaper is not wet, and
that no pins are pricking him. Often
merely a change of position is sufficient
to quiet him. Do not take him up at the
first cry; most babies like to be held and
will often cry simply to be taken up.</p>

<p><b>Cry due to colic.</b> The cry of colic is
sharp and spasmodic. The baby will
draw his legs up, and the muscles of the
abdomen will be hard and tense.</p>

<p><b>Cry due to hunger.</b> The normal cry of
hunger is heard some time before the feeding
is due, and is accompanied by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
sucking of the thumb or the fingers. If the
baby is not getting sufficient nourishment,
the cry of hunger is a continuous fretful
sound and is heard soon after a feeding.</p>

<p><b>Cry due to temper.</b> The cry of temper
is loud and strong; the baby usually kicks,
and his body stiffens. This is easily recognized,
because when the baby gets what
he wants he will stop at once. When
a baby cries from temper let him cry it
out. The struggle will not be long, because
he will soon learn that this crying
is useless.</p>

<p><b>Cry due to illness or fright.</b> The cry of
most forms of illness is low, moaning, and
fretful. The cry of fright is sudden and
loud. The child should be taken up,
comforted, and put down again as soon
as he is quieted. In all cases of persistent
crying the doctor should be called if the
mother does not succeed in her attempts
at quieting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<p><b>Exercise.</b> The young baby gets his exercise
by crying (which expands his lungs),
also by kicking and waving the arms. It
is important that the clothing should not
be so tight as to interfere with these
natural movements.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image086.jpg" alt="A baby laying on its back with one
arm raised">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BABY EXERCISING</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When he is in short clothes, at regular
times each day he should be placed on
the floor, on a thick blanket, and allowed
to roll and creep about at will.</p>

<p>Twice a day if possible, but always just
before bedtime, the baby should be placed
on a large bed in a warm room with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
his clothing removed, and should be encouraged
to kick and play for ten or fifteen
minutes. He may be played with
at this time, but must not be permitted
to become excited.</p>

<b>3.</b> Demonstrate the care of the toothbrush and
explain the necessity for such care.</p>
</div>

<p>The best way to secure sound, healthy
teeth in a baby is for the mother during
her girlhood to see that her own teeth are
in good condition and to keep well and
happy, because it is then that the foundations
of health for life are established.
The mother must take the best care of
her teeth at all times and maintain her
health in every possible way. A sickly
mother usually means a sickly baby.</p>

<p>The first teeth of the child are called
the milk teeth and are twenty in number.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
In a normal baby the first tooth usually
appears about the sixth month.</p>

<p>The teeth usually come as follows:</p>

<table class="autotable">
<tr>
<td>Two lower central incisors</td>
<td></td>
<td>6 to  9 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Four upper incisors</td>
<td></td>
<td>8 to 12 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Two lower lateral incisors</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="fs200">}</td>
<td rowspan="2">12 to 18 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Four anterior molars</td>

<tr>
<td>Four canines (the “eye” and “stomach” teeth)</td>
<td></td>
<td>18 to 24 months</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Four posterior molars</td>
<td></td>
<td>24 to 30 months</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>Cleansing the teeth.</b> As soon as the
first tooth appears, it should be cleansed
each day with a small piece of gauze or
cotton saturated in a weak solution of
bicarbonate of soda and water. A teaspoonful
of water after each feeding or
after taking fruit juice will help to cleanse
the mouth.</p>

<p><b>Drooling.</b> When the baby is about four
months old the flow of saliva is increased.
This is an indication that the salivary
glands are developing, and not, as is commonly
thought, a sign that the teeth are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
trying to push their way through the
gums, although this may be the case.</p>

<p><b>Teething.</b> Babies nourished by healthy
breast milk cut their teeth earlier than
those who are bottle fed. When the teeth
begin to come the gums are apt to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
red and swollen. Special care should be
taken at this time to keep the mouth
clean. It is a mistake to dread the teething
period and to feel that the baby is
sure to be sick. Sickness at this time
usually attributed to teething is more apt
to be due to faulty feeding or to some
other condition, and the family physician
should be consulted at once.</p>

<p><b>Diet.</b> Good teeth in a baby depend
largely on his diet. During the first few
months of his life, in addition to milk he
should be given fruit juice and meat juice
(see <a href="#APPENDIX_B">Appendix B</a>). As his teeth develop he
should be given food that requires chewing;
this is necessary to keep the teeth
and muscles of the jaw strong and healthy.</p>

<p><b>Teeth and their care.</b> By the time the
child is two and a half years old the temporary
teeth should be fully developed.
These are replaced by the permanent
teeth, which usually begin to appear about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the sixth year. Their condition will largely
depend upon the care given to the first
teeth; neglect of the temporary teeth is
a frequent cause of decay in the permanent
teeth.</p>

<p>After the teeth come they should be
cleansed with a soft brush in the morning
and after the evening meal. A good
mouth wash consists of a two per cent
boric acid solution or a weak solution of
bicarbonate of soda and water (one-half
teaspoonful to a glass of water).</p>

<p><b>Care of the toothbrush.</b> After being
used the toothbrush should be cleansed
with soap and warm water, thoroughly
rinsed, and completely dried. Each day
it is well to place the brush in the
sunshine.</p>

<p><b>Suggestions for demonstrations.</b> <b>1.</b> Describe
the bath thermometer and illustrate its use with
water at different temperatures. <b>2.</b> Demonstrate
the preparation of an enema and show the correct
position of the body when taking one. <b>3.</b> Show
how to protect the baby from infection when the
mother has a cold.</p>
</div>

<p>Babies should be protected from excessive
excitement. The brain grows as
much during the first year as it does
during the entire remainder of life. As
the baby’s nervous system is easily upset,
he should be kept free from disturbing
influences.</p>

<p><b>Convulsions.</b> Anything which upsets
the baby’s nervous system may interfere
with the process of digestion. This, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
well as improper food, constipation, or
some acute illness may be the cause
of convulsions. When in a convulsion,
the baby loses consciousness, the legs
and arms stiffen, and the facial muscles
begin to twitch. Send for a doctor at
once. Meanwhile the baby should be
placed in a tub of warm water. If a thermometer
is not at hand, some adult
should always test the temperature by
placing her arm, up to the elbow, in the
water. Great care should be taken that the
water is not too hot, as many babies have
been seriously burned in this way. The
temperature of the water should be slowly
raised to 108° F. by adding hot water.
A cold compress should be placed on
the child’s head and frequently changed.
When the convulsion ceases the child
should be removed from the bath and
wrapped in a warm blanket, and his face
should be bathed with cold water. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
necessary, he may be kept in the bath
about twenty minutes. If a child has
convulsions and a tub is not
available, he should be wrapped
in a large bath towel which has
been dipped in water at a temperature
of 104° F., wrapped
in a soft blanket, and the face
and hands should be bathed in
cold water.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image095.jpg" alt="A bath thermometer for baths">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BATH THERMOMETER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Colic.</b> Colic, or a pain in the
bowels, is indicated by a sharp,
spasmodic cry, a drawing up of
the legs, and a contraction of
the muscles of the face and
abdomen. The sufferer should
be given a little warm water to
drink and should have a soft,
hot flannel placed over the abdomen and
around the feet, or he should be laid on
his stomach across a hot-water bag which
is protected by a cloth covering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>

<p><b>Constipation.</b> It is important that the
mother who is nursing a baby should have
a free movement of the bowels each day;
if her bowels are kept open and her digestion
is good, the baby will not, as a rule,
be constipated. A little water given to
the baby between feedings will help to
prevent constipation. Fruit juices, such as
prune and orange juice, should also be
given. The most effective way of overcoming
or preventing constipation is to
develop the habit of having the bowels
move at the same time each day. The
baby should not be allowed to go more
than twenty-four hours without a movement.
Except in emergency, however, do
not give the baby an enema or suppository
or any medicine unless ordered to do so
by a physician.</p>

<p><b>Enema.</b> An enema of two to four
ounces of warm water, to which has been
added a little soapsuds and one or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
tablespoonfuls of warm olive oil, will usually
cause a movement of the bowels.</p>

<p><b>Directions for giving an enema.</b> Place
the baby on his back with a folded towel
under his buttocks. A soft rubber catheter
is safer to use than the hard rubber nozzle
provided for this purpose. Allow the water
to run freely through the catheter before
inserting, so as to prevent injecting cold
water and air into the rectum. Lift the
baby’s feet with the left hand and with the
right insert the oiled catheter gently into
the rectum for two or three inches.</p>

<p><b>Diarrhea.</b> A well baby usually has one
or two movements a day. Frequent movements,
or diarrhea, may be the beginning
of a severe illness, and a physician should
be consulted at once. This condition occurs
more frequently with bottle-fed babies. If
it occurs in a breast-fed baby, it is usually
because the mother has not been careful
about her diet or because the baby has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
been given improper food. To relieve
this condition, if a physician is not at
hand, give one teaspoonful of castor oil
and omit the feeding in order to let the
baby’s stomach rest.</p>

<p><b>Prevention of chafing.</b> The skin of the
baby is sensitive and may be easily irritated.
For this reason the baby’s diaper
should be removed as soon as soiled and
the skin cleansed with warm water. The
folds of the skin should be thoroughly
dried and dusted with a little talcum
powder, or olive oil may be applied, before
the clean diaper is put on.</p>

<p><b>Colds.</b> Common colds are contagious
and in infants often lead to serious illness.
A mother with a cold, when nursing her
baby, should tie a handkerchief loosely
over her nose and mouth in order to protect
the child from infection if she should
cough or sneeze. Many children’s diseases,
such as whooping cough, measles, etc.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
are transmitted through the secretions of
the nose and mouth. Any member of
the family who has a cold should keep
away from the children, and particularly
from the baby.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>PROTECTING THE BABY FROM HIS MOTHER’S COLD</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<p><b>Vaccination.</b> Before the discovery of vaccine,
smallpox was the most dreaded disease
in the world and more prevalent than
measles is to-day. A hundred years ago it
was considered a disease of the children;
to-day, by the simple and safe process of
vaccination, it has been almost entirely
eliminated, except in those localities where
through prejudice or ignorance the children
are not vaccinated. Therefore every
baby should be vaccinated before he is six
months old; this should be repeated at
about six years of age, and later if there
is a smallpox epidemic.</p>

<p>The best place for vaccination is on the
left arm. If the leg be selected, as it is
occasionally (especially with girls), the child
should stay in bed during the reaction
following vaccination.</p>

<p>The aftercare of a vaccinated child is
important. A dressing of clean, sterile
gauze should be placed over the point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
vaccination and held in place with strips
of adhesive plaster. The dressing should
be changed only by the physician or under
his orders. If it sticks to the scab, it
should not be pulled off; the cloth should
be cut away around it and a small piece
left adhering to the arm and a fresh dressing
placed over this. Do not apply vaseline
or any kind of ointment to the point
of inoculation. Nothing must touch it
but clean boiled water and sterile dressing
handled by clean hands.</p>

<p>A vaccinated child should have a bath
and a change of underwear daily, but it is
important that the dressing over the vaccination
should be kept clean and dry. The
child should not be permitted to play in
gardens, stables, or dusty streets until the
arm has completely healed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>

<p class="center bold">ORGANIZATION OF THE GIRLS’ HEALTH
LEAGUE CLASSES</p>


<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Preliminary Meeting</span></h3>

<p>The mothers and teachers should be invited
and urged to attend the meeting for the organization
of a class. The success of this movement
for the health of our girls and for the
saving of our babies depends largely upon the
interest and coöperation of the mothers and
teachers.</p>

<p>The organizer should preside, and the school
physician should be asked to explain the object
of the league.</p>

<p>At this preliminary meeting membership cards
should be distributed to those desiring to join
the class. These are not to be signed until the
girls have taken them home and secured the
signatures of their parents or guardians. While
everything possible should be done to make the
club proposition attractive, no girl should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
urged to join against her will. An unwilling
member is not a good member.</p>

<p>In order to secure careful personal supervision
and free discussion, a class of not more than
twelve is desirable, but as many as twenty-four
may be directed by an experienced teacher.</p>

<p>The form of membership card is given below:</p>

<p class="center bold">RECIPES</p>

<p><b>Limewater.</b> To make limewater, add one teaspoonful
of unslaked lime to one quart of cool,
boiled water. Pour into a bottle and shake thoroughly.
Let it stand twenty-four hours; pour off
the clear fluid at the top and strain. Keep in a
cool place.</p>

<p><b>Barley water.</b> Mix two teaspoonfuls of barley
flour with a little cold water, then add one quart
of water and boil twenty minutes in a double
boiler. Strain through a very fine sieve and add
enough boiled water to make one quart.</p>

<p><b>Rice water.</b> Rice water is made in the same
way as barley water, but only one teaspoonful of rice
is used to one quart of water.</p>

<p><b>Oatmeal water.</b> Mix two even tablespoonfuls
of oatmeal with a little cold water; add one quart
of water and boil for at least one hour in a
double boiler. Strain through a fine sieve and
add enough boiled water to make one quart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<p><b>Beef juice.</b> Select the third cut of the round
lean beef, broil it slightly on both sides, cut in
small pieces, and squeeze the juice from it with
a potato ricer or a meat press. Add a pinch of
salt, and before using warm it slightly by standing
the cup containing the juice in a dish of
hot water.</p>

<p><b>Whey.</b> Warm one pint of fresh milk to about
110° F. Add one teaspoonful of essence of pepsin
or a junket tablet and stir until it is well
mixed. Pour into cups and let stand until it
jellies. Then break up the curds with a fork
and strain through a sieve. The liquid is called
whey, and it is sometimes used when babies
cannot digest cow’s milk.</p>

<p><b>Two per cent boric acid solution.</b> Put one
teaspoonful of boric acid powder in a pint of
boiling water and keep in a clean bottle.</p>

<p><b>Soap suppository.</b> Take a piece of Ivory or
castile soap and cut out a piece two inches long
and about the size of a lead pencil. Narrow to
a dull point at one end.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
